20342497,SPSS ICN,Incident,Desktop Support - Faculty/Staff,Unassigned,Service Desk,System User,Service Desk,None,None,"Hello, 

 
 


 
 
I am wondering whether you can inform me of the ICN (IBM customer number: 
https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/what-my-ibm-customer-number-icn ) for SPSS. I am about to request for user support and to make such request, IBM statistics asks for an ICN.


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 What is my IBM Customer Number (ICN)? 
 
Answer. An IBM Customer Number (ICN) is the unique number that IBM issues its customers during the post contract signing entitlement process. At the time the ICN is issued to the IBM customer, IBM identifies a Site Technical Contact (STC) from your company.
 These individuals received emails that contained your organization's ICN.

Everything is running well, but Zoomtext is not active on the login screen. It’s not a big deal, but if I type the wrong password, it is necessary. If you go to the Zoomtext interface and open the “Zoomtext” menu in the top left, then choose “Preferences” > “Program” it will open a dialogue box. Select the check box next to “Enable Zoomtext in the Windows Logon Prompt.” When I do it, it asks for a username and password. It won’t accept mine. I am assuming it needs administrator privileges for this change. Thanks, Kevin Shanley Associate Professor & Chair

 I am not sure how to handle Amy's request for a specific desk in WH311.

I am not privy to the design of 311 and the form that Nancy had me fill out does not include detail such as desk location. 
 I appreciate any information you may have,

Hi, Sue, 
 Thanks again for updating me about the change of office. If possible, I’d prefer to use the desk in the back of the room (further away from the door). Would you mind requesting that the computer and phone be moved to that desk, if that hasn’t already been done. Thanks so much and have a great weekend! 
 Best always, Amy

 Subject: for this meeting on Monday   Dear Beth, Somehow my reply was not sent successfully, sorry about the delay. Thanks for sharing those important updates. Congratulations on your new President and new Dean of the School of Education. I already share this important news of my president and new dean. And she expressed her sincere congratulations for them and would like to have face-to-face meeting with them after the international travel totally returns to normal status. We also look forward to having more deep cooperation with you and your team. For the meeting with the students and parents of new cohort, it would be perfect that you will join us. After discussing with the dean of School of Preschool Education, this meeting could start at 8:00 on Monday September 19. Alan, who is Aiko’s co-teacher and familiar with our program, will translate for this meeting. As for the platform, we recommend to use Tencent Meeting because most Chinese parents already have Tencent meeting App on mobile phone. It’s very like Zoom or Webex and allows you to share the powerpoint. The students and parents will also use Tencent Meeting. You can download it from the App store in advance. Please let me know if you have problem in using Tencent Meeting. By the way, Yuke will invite graduated students to attend this meeting and share their great feelings with new cohort students. Have a nice day! Sincerely, Sheffee     ??? ?? ?? ?????????????? ? ???????????

Or would you prefer another platform? o I am so happy that the new Dual Diploma students can join the meeting! Is it possible to invite the students who graduated in May 2022 to join the meeting? Thank you for organizing the meeting. We look forward to participating!

 Subject: Re:RE: Best wishes for new semester from CQUE Dear Beth,   Chongqing is much cooler now and is beautiful in fall.   The academic calendar does not include all the holidays or the fieldwork dates, it just shows the basic academic weeks.   I really appreciate your effort in making the promotional video. We can play it in the meeting, and I believe it will be helpful for promoting our program. We will also invite five CQUE students who are studying at New Paltz now to join the meeting.   Please let me know the result of your discussion with the School of Education.   Best, Sheffee     ??? ?? ?? ?????????????? ? ???????????

We have just started our new semester with a week of classes and then a long holiday weekend – Labor Day – and it is wonderful to have the Dual Diploma students on campus again! They seem to be doing very well and are quite active already with their classes and other activities. Thank you so much for sharing this information about your academic calendar. Does this include all the holidays that take place throughout the semesters? And thank you for inviting us to join the meeting with freshmen students and their parents. Kathy and I will be meeting with the School of Education on Thursday so we can discuss this invitation together. I think that an in-person conversation will be better than a video now. However, I want to let you know that we are preparing a promotional video that you can translate into Chinese and share with students and families at any time. It features the students that graduated in May and the Faculty who teach in the program as well as scenes of campus and the Children’s Center. I apologize that this is taking us longer than we expected, but I am excited that it will a compelling picture of the experience that the Dual Diploma students have when they come to New Paltz. All the best as you also begin a new academic year and we look forward to seeing you (virtually) soon!

 Subject: Best wishes for new semester from CQUE Dear Beth,   Greetings! Hope this email finds you well.   After the hottest westher in Chongqing this summer , I feel so great to have a nice weather now. It was terrible to have the high temperature above 112 Fahrenheit degree. It is the first time in my life. How about your summer holiday? I miss the nice weather in New Paltz.   Now I would like to share some information about this new semester. The Fall 2022 semester has officially stated here at CQUE. We are now working from home due to the pandemic, and we will return to the office next Monday.   The non-freshmen classes will start on September 5, and freshmen classes will start on September 12. We are planning to do an online meeting for all freshmen and their parents on week September 12 or 19 in the evening (your morning time). We would like to invite you to join us for this meeting if your time is available. Or if it’s fine for you, a short video will also be grateful.   The schedules of the three New Paltz faculties who will start teaching soon have been checked and finalized. Thank you for your continued support in the assignment of teaching faculty.The five CQUE students seem lovely at New Paltz now. I’m so glad they are there and thank you also for taking care of our students.   I’ve attached the CQUE academic calendar for your reference.   Looking forward to seeing you on the annual meeting later 2022.   Best wishes, Sheffee   Lamei Luo, Ph.D Deputy Dean, International College Chongqing University of Education 1 Chongjiao Road, Nanshan Street, Nan'an District, Chongqing, China 400065 ? ? ???? ???? ? ? ???? ????    "
